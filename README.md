# React Portfolio

## Overview

This project is a personal portfolio built using React. It showcases my web development projects and skills, allowing potential employers to evaluate my work and capabilities as a web developer. The portfolio includes multiple sections: About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, all accessible without page reloading thanks to React's single-page application (SPA) architecture.

## User Story

## Acceptance Criteria

2. **Navigation**: The navigation includes links to About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume sections, with the current section highlighted.
3. **Default View**: Upon loading, the About Me section is displayed by default.
4. **About Me Section**: Displays a recent photo and a short bio.
5. **Portfolio Section**: Features six projects with titles, images, and links to both the deployed applications and their GitHub repositories.
6. **Contact Section**: Includes a contact form with required fields for name, email, and message. Validations are in place for empty fields and invalid email addresses.
